                At some point of time, life usually ends, but the quest and curiosity about life and its goals never ends.  I have been wading through this big ocean of lifes quest,<br>
                
            </p>
            <h3 class="sayingfont">I have found some rythmic crests and troughs,<br> some bring meaning and some doubts.</h3>
            <br>
            Among all the waves and tides lies another ocean... a world of opportunities that is always shortlived but last longer for those who grasp it.<br><br>
            <h2>About Me..</h2> 
                
            
            Bold, dashing and spirited. It's a bit difficult to keep pace with me.. no matter how close u get. I love to live a life as free as the wind, but yet being safe.<br><br> 
            Quite times, away from the madding crowd, lush green meadows, pondering on self and doing something useful are some of my most favorite things to do..!!

            <h2>My Career path..</h2> 
           <img src="./Index_files/download.jpg" alt="The logo" width="312" height="392" style="float:right">

            I have spent a big part of my career with wide variety of Retail Partners and worked
            closely with IT Support and Development Teams. During the early and Mid part of my
            career, I have been in management/sales roles and helped achieve organizational goals and targets.

            As part of my career I have travelled to different parts of the US, meeting various clients for new project sign-ups and end-to-end project implementations.<br><br>

            <p>Over the past 6 years I have been working as part of Support Team in identifying and
            constantly improving the Support Processes in Applications, Web Portals, Hardware
            and Network front.

            In my endeavor to enhance the support processes, I have spearheaded teams of
            developers and support analysts. As I come from a hardware and networking
            background, dealing predominantly with network routers/switches, servers, data
            centers, etc, I also wanted to learn about how the different application and websites
            interact and work in helping us run our daily business. This drove me to learn coding
            and help enhance my skills recently.</p>        
            <br>
            <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
            No matter what work I am associated with, I would alway looks for opportunities to optimize the work and eliminate redundant tasks.  In view of that;</p>
            <p>1) I would want to develop codes/scripts, portals that would help the IT world in optimizing the work for q quick turnover.</p>
            <p>2) To own an organization that does process automations for IT support companies.
